# Polymer apps routing system

In this repository I tried to do a system routing for one polymer App
The example duplicate index.html, contact.html,... Because not is the main purpose of the spike.

We have three important considerations

* src folder contain all our webcomponents and we can use one for any page our commons webcomponents or similar.
* we have a js folder, we can do all our business rules and it comunicates with all wc, by the octopus wc.
* The octopus wc, is the main component of our page, and has all webcomponents access in it. It can do too, some binding actions.

** The project only use events handling clicking on the buttons **
